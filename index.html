            <ul>
                <li><strong>Define Your Priorities:</strong> Are you after raw power, daily drivability, or a mix of both? Decide whether you want a track-focused car like the Camaro ZL1 or a more practical option like the Mustang GT.</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Wisely:</strong> Muscle cars range from $40,000 to over $100,000. Factor in maintenance, insurance, and fuel costs, especially for high-performance models.</li>

                <li><strong>Research Resale Value:</strong> Muscle cars like the Mustang and Challenger tend to hold their value well. Check resale data to make an informed decision.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Financing Options:</strong> Look for manufacturer incentives or low-interest loans to make your purchase more affordable.</li>
            </ul>
